Hello, This is a lil experiment I've made over the course of like, a few hours, it actually took a couple of days because I didn't know what I want to do with it, but like, here it is.
It's simple to use but I might make a small wiki for it.

It really is just because I wanted to make something small in C++ that used a sort of wire transfer system to talk between different objects.
